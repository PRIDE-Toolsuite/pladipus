<h2 id="Development">1. Development</h2>
Pladipus was originally developed at the <a href='http://compomics.com/'>CompOmics</a> group at <a href='http://www.ugent.be/en'>Ghent University</a>, Belgium (part of <a href='http://www.vib.be/'>VIB</a>) as
part of a pipeline for large scale reprocessing of public proteomics data from the <a href='http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/'>PRIDE</a> database.

Since the initial developments, Pladipus has been enhanced to have many capabilities 
which can be applied to many computationally intense problems that can be "embarrassingly parallelised".
Since the initial prototype, Pladipus has become a true cluster management system and has been continuously operated
at the <a href='http://compomics.com/'>CompOmics</a> group.
<br>
<br>
Examples of applied usages for the Pladipus Framework applications include:
<ul>
    <li>Extraction of both precursor and fragment ion mass accuracies for all projects in <a href='http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/'>PRIDE</a></li>
    <li>Generation of a database of theoretical peptides using <a href='http://compomics.com/ms2pip/'>MS2PIP</li>
    <li>Reprocessing of all human projects in <a href='http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/'>PRIDE</a> against UniProtKB</li>
</ul>
